- HTML Notes

---
### HTML Notes
- <div> tags have no inherent meaning, use for management
-
### Running notes
- Markdown does not display from readme or html files
- the default title bar may be a default if nothing special is defined in the index
- you can use a markdown file for markdown alternative to html
- if you do so, the title defaults to a plain text readout of the link
