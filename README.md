### HTML Notes
- tag based, no line ender
- <div> tags have no inherent meaning, use for management
- em is a relative font size that stacks
  - 2em would be 2x the em value set by font size(default is 16px)
-
- the default title bar may be a default if nothing special is defined in the index

### CSS
- end all non bracket lines with semicolon
- classes are defined by [.class{}]
- can make tag specific class by [tag.class{}]


### Website plan
 - l.vert. nav bar with links to other pages
 - top.horiz. nav bar for sub-section links
 - bold black font for name in left nav
 - pastel green for page titles
 -
