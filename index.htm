          <p>
            Hello, I’m Achille Hebert III, a recent UCLA grad with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with technical breadth in computer science. During my time at UCLA, I worked on yearly Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED) outreach programs while also working a part-time job for around 20 hours per week. I also worked on the design of the avionics and manufacturing of the 2019 Bearospace First Nation’s Launch (FNL) rocket, where we won first place that year. I also began volunteering my time after work and class as a supervisor at the UCLA Innovation Lab, known as the UCLA Makerspace at the time. At the time, I was taking on leadership roles at my Catering Job as well as taking positions in the office department, giving me a fuller picture of the whole operation. Later, I transitioned into a paid position at the Makerspace as opposed to Catering.
          </p>
          <p>Goals</p>
          <p>
            Currently I am looking for work in industry. Preferably in positions with responsibilities similar to the work I did in projects throughout college. This includes design and manufacturing, as well as some light electronics and programming. Separate from projects that I have worked on, I am also interested in greener technology. After a few years working in industry, I plan to go into grad school in order to further pursue topics in aerospace or to widen my breath into a related engineering field of interest.

          <p>Website Explanation</p>
          <p>
            This website is basically a blog of the work I’ve done in the past. I’ll cover projects and jobs I work in detail with personal narration. This also allows me to cover failed projects. Which I would not be able to meaningfully cover in any other professional platform, despite providing some useful lessons learned. To ease navigation, both the projects and jobs page have summaries of each individual article, with links to the full write-up.
